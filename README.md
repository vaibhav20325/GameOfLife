At the heart of this game are four rules that determine if a cell is live or dead. All depend on how many of that cell's neighbors are alive.

* Births: Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbors will become live in the next generation.
* Death by isolation: Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbors will die in the next generation.
* Death by overcrowding: Each live cell with four or more live neighbors will die in the next generation.
* Survival: Each live cell with either two or three live neighbors will remain alive for the next generation.

Another important fact about the rules for the game of life is that all rules apply to all cells at the same time.
